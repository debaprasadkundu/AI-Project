Your code is already clean and doesn't contain any comments. If there were any comments, they would look like this:

```jsx
// This is a single line comment

/*
  This is a
  multi-line comment
*/
```

To remove them, you would simply delete these lines. But as I said, your provided code doesn't contain any comments to remove.
